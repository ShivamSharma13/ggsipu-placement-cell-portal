## Web Portal for the Placement Cell of GGSIP University

- I undertook this project independently for my major project along with 2 other classmates. (check collabs)
- This portal was developed with the vision to serve as a unified platform to manage and streamline the placement activities at the GGSIP University, with which there are over 120 colleges associated.
- The project is no longer used or maintained (due to a major change in the upper management of the university).
- However, this platform proved to be of utmost vitality during the 2018 placements of USIT students.
- The website was live through the funds provided by the university for server space, which is no longer the case.

- We intend to keep the website live, provided someone at the university's Server Cell does not update the DNS Certificates, which would most likely be on a 30th Feb.
- We would like to thank the following faculty for their support throughtout:
  - Dr. Manoj Kumar Satyarthi
  - Mr. Pankaj Singh
  - Dr. C.S. Rai
  - Mr. Ajit Pratap
